# smart-astronaut-ia
This project simulates an autonomous astronaut navigating a 10x10 Martian grid to collect scientific samples using intelligent search algorithms. The environment includes natural obstacles, variable terrain costs (rocky and volcanic), and a limited-fuel auxiliary spacecraft that temporarily reduces movement cost.
